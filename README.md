# Curryrs

Curryrs (a play on the name of Haskell Curry, rs for Rust libraries, and
it's pronunciation couriers) is a library for providing easy to use bindings
between Rust and Haskell Code. Given the Type Safety inherent in both
languages Curryrs seeks to bridge the gap between the two languages by
providing an interface to Haskell to use a safe, but high speed,
language when performance is critical.

In the future Curryrs will provide a way to easily use Haskell Code
inside of Rust itself, perfect for manipulation of large data sets or
when functional programming is easier to reason about than procedural
code.
